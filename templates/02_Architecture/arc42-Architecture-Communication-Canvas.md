# üó£Ô∏è arc42 Architecture Communication Canvas: [System/Project Name]

This canvas helps to plan and structure the communication of architectural information for the [System/Project Name]. Effective communication ensures that all stakeholders understand the architecture, its implications, and their role in its success.

---

## 1. Context & Scope

### 1.1 What is the architecture we are communicating?

[Briefly describe the system or part of the system whose architecture is being communicated. What are its boundaries?]

### 1.2 Why is this communication needed?

[What is the purpose of this communication? What problem are we solving or what goal are we achieving through this communication? (e.g., "to align development teams," "to get stakeholder approval," "to onboard new team members").]

## 2. Stakeholders

### 2.1 Who are the target audiences for this communication?

[Identify all relevant stakeholder groups. Think broadly: technical, business, operations, management, external partners, etc.]

* **[Stakeholder Group 1]:** [e.g., "Software Development Team"]
* **[Stakeholder Group 2]:** [e.g., "Product Management"]
* **[Stakeholder Group 3]:** [e.g., "Senior Leadership"]
* **[Stakeholder Group 4]:** [e.g., "Operations Team"]
* **[Stakeholder Group 5]:** [e.g., "External Auditors/Regulators"]

## 3. Communication Goals & Needs per Stakeholder

### 3.1 What does each stakeholder group need to know, and why?

[For each stakeholder group, define their specific information needs and the goal of communicating with them.]

* **[Stakeholder Group 1]:**
    * **Needs:** [e.g., "Detailed component interactions, API specifications, technology choices."]
    * **Goal:** [e.g., "Enable efficient implementation, ensure adherence to standards."]
* **[Stakeholder Group 2]:**
    * **Needs:** [e.g., "High-level system capabilities, impact on roadmap, cost implications."]
    * **Goal:** [e.g., "Inform product decisions, secure budget approval."]
* **[Stakeholder Group 3]:**
    * **Needs:** [e.g., "Strategic alignment, key risks, progress against objectives."]
    * **Goal:** [e.g., "Maintain oversight, make strategic decisions."]
* **[Stakeholder Group 4]:**
    * **Needs:** [e.g., "Deployment procedures, monitoring points, operational dependencies."]
    * **Goal:** [e.g., "Ensure smooth operations, facilitate troubleshooting."]
* **[Stakeholder Group 5]:**
    * **Needs:** [e.g., "Compliance evidence, traceability, security measures."]
    * **Goal:** [e.g., "Pass audits, demonstrate regulatory adherence."]

## 4. Communication Channels & Artifacts

### 4.1 How will we communicate with each stakeholder group?

[For each stakeholder group, identify the most effective communication channels and the specific architectural artifacts or views that will be used.]

* **[Stakeholder Group 1]:**
    * **Channel(s):** [e.g., "Team meetings, code reviews, internal wiki."]
    * **Artifacts/Views:** [e.g., "C4 Model (Component/Code), Detailed Design Docs, ADRs, Sequence Diagrams."]
* **[Stakeholder Group 2]:**
    * **Channel(s):** [e.g., "Product strategy sessions, executive summaries, workshops."]
    * **Artifacts/Views:** [e.g., "C4 Model (Context/Container), High-Level Roadmaps, Impact Assessments."]
* **[Stakeholder Group 3]:**
    * **Channel(s):** [e.g., "Steering committee meetings, formal presentations."]
    * **Artifacts/Views:** [e.g., "Executive Summaries, Risk Register (high-level), Strategic Alignment Diagrams."]
* **[Stakeholder Group 4]:**
    * **Channel(s):** [e.g., "Handover sessions, runbooks, monitoring dashboards."]
    * **Artifacts/Views:** [e.g., "Deployment Diagrams, Operational Playbooks, System Monitoring Dashboards."]
* **[Stakeholder Group 5]:**
    * **Channel(s):** [e.g., "Formal documentation review, audit meetings."]
    * **Artifacts/Views:** [e.g., "Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM), Compliance Reports, Security Architecture Document."]

## 5. Frequency & Timing

### 5.1 When and how often will we communicate?

[Define the frequency and timing of communication for each stakeholder group.]

* **[Stakeholder Group 1]:** [e.g., "Daily stand-ups, weekly design syncs, ad-hoc as needed."]
* **[Stakeholder Group 2]:** [e.g., "Bi-weekly product reviews, quarterly strategy sessions."]
* **[Stakeholder Group 3]:** [e.g., "Monthly executive briefings, quarterly strategic reviews."]

## 6. Responsibilities

### 6.1 Who is responsible for communicating what, and to whom?

[Assign clear responsibilities for preparing and delivering architectural communications.]

* **[Role/Name 1]:** [e.g., "Lead Architect - Responsible for C4 Context/Container diagrams, ADRs, and presenting to Senior Leadership."]
* **[Role/Name 2]:** [e.g., "Team Lead - Responsible for detailed design docs, code reviews, and daily team syncs."]
* **[Role/Name 3]:** [e.g., "Product Owner - Responsible for communicating architectural impact on roadmap to business stakeholders."]

## 7. Feedback & Improvement

### 7.1 How will we gather feedback on our communication effectiveness?

[How will we ensure our communication is understood and effective? How will we improve it over time?]

* [e.g., "Regular feedback sessions with stakeholders."]
* [e.g., "Surveys on documentation clarity."]
* [e.g., "Tracking questions/misunderstandings during meetings."]
