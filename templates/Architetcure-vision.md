# 🔭 Architecture Vision: [System/Product Name]

This document defines the overarching architectural vision for the [System/Product Name]. It describes the desired future state of the system's architecture, its strategic alignment, and the high-level goals it aims to achieve. This vision serves as a guiding star for all architectural and design decisions, ensuring consistency and alignment with business objectives.

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Architecture Vision document is to:
* Articulate a clear and inspiring long-term direction for the system's architecture.
* Align all stakeholders (business, product, development, operations) on the architectural strategy.
* Provide a high-level blueprint for subsequent detailed design and implementation efforts.
* Ensure the architecture supports current and future business needs and product capabilities.

### 1.2 Scope

This document covers the architectural vision for the [System/Product Name]. It focuses on the strategic direction, key drivers, and high-level approaches, rather than detailed design specifications or specific architectural principles (which are covered in a separate document).

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms

[List any architecture-specific terms, definitions, or acronyms used in this document.]

## 2. Architecture Vision Statement

A concise, inspiring statement that defines the desired future state of the architecture. It should convey the essence of what the architecture will enable and how it will contribute to the overall success.

*Example: To build a highly scalable, resilient, and adaptable cloud-native architecture that enables rapid feature delivery, global reach, and continuous innovation for our [Product Name] platform.*

## 3. Strategic Alignment

How does this architecture vision directly support and enable the overarching business strategy and product vision? What core business problems does it help solve, or what opportunities does it unlock?

* [Reference relevant business objectives, OKRs, or the Product Vision.]
* [Explain how the architecture provides a competitive advantage or addresses market needs.]

## 4. Key Architectural Goals & Objectives

What are the specific, measurable goals that this architecture aims to achieve? These should be outcomes that the architecture enables.

* **[Goal 1]:** [e.g., "Achieve 99.99% availability for core services."]
* **[Goal 2]:** [e.g., "Reduce average deployment time for new features by 50%."]
* **[Goal 3]:** [e.g., "Support a 10x increase in user concurrency within 3 years."]
* **[Goal 4]:** [e.g., "Ensure compliance with [specific regulation, e.g., GDPR, ISO 27001] by design."]
* **[Goal 5]:** [e.g., "Minimize operational cost per user by 20% over 2 years."]

## 5. Key Architectural Drivers & Concerns

What are the primary factors that influence and shape this architecture? These are the forces that the architecture must address.

* **Performance:** [e.g., low latency requirements, high transaction throughput.]
* **Scalability:** [e.g., anticipated growth in users/data, elastic demand.]
* **Security:** [e.g., data privacy, threat landscape, compliance mandates.]
* **Reliability/Resilience:** [e.g., fault tolerance, disaster recovery, uptime targets.]
* **Maintainability/Evolvability:** [e.g., ease of change, technical debt management, future-proofing.]
* **Cost:** [e.g., operational expenses, development costs, infrastructure spend.]
* **Time-to-Market:** [e.g., rapid prototyping, continuous delivery needs.]
* **Usability/Developer Experience:** [e.g., ease of use for internal teams, onboarding new developers.]
* **Regulatory/Compliance:** [e.g., industry-specific standards, data residency.]
* **Technology Constraints:** [e.g., existing tech stack, specific vendor requirements.]

## 6. High-Level Architectural Strategy

What are the main strategic approaches or patterns that will be adopted to achieve the vision and goals? This is the "how" at a conceptual level.

* **[Strategy 1]:** [e.g., "Cloud-Native First: Leverage managed cloud services for scalability and reduced operational overhead."]
* **[Strategy 2]:** [e.g., "Microservices Architecture: Decompose functionality into independently deployable services for agility and resilience."]
* **[Strategy 3]:** [e.g., "Event-Driven Architecture: Utilize asynchronous messaging for loose coupling and real-time data flow."]
* **[Strategy 4]:** [e.g., "API-First Design: Expose well-defined APIs for all services to promote interoperability."]
* **[Strategy 5]:** [e.g., "Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Automate infrastructure provisioning and management."]
* **[Strategy 6]:** [e.g., "Security by Design: Embed security controls and practices throughout the development lifecycle."]

## 7. Key Architectural Decisions (High-Level)

Summarize or reference any fundamental architectural decisions that have already been made or are critical to this vision. These should ideally link to specific Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

* [ADR-001: Choice of Cloud Provider (AWS/Azure/GCP)]
* [ADR-005: Primary Database Technology Selection (e.g., PostgreSQL)]
* [ADR-010: Main Communication Protocol (e.g., gRPC vs. REST)]

## 8. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

What is explicitly *not* covered or aimed for by this architecture vision? This helps manage expectations and focus efforts.

* [e.g., "Detailed component-level design (covered in SDS documents)."]
* [e.g., "Specific implementation details for non-core functionalities."]
* [e.g., "Support for legacy systems beyond defined integration points."]

## 9. High-Level Roadmap & Evolution

Provide a conceptual view of how the architecture is expected to evolve over time, aligning with product roadmap phases.

* **Phase 1 (Foundation):** [e.g., "Establish core cloud infrastructure, deploy foundational services."]
* **Phase 2 (Expansion):** [e.g., "Migrate key business domains, introduce advanced data processing."]
* **Phase 3 (Optimization):** [e.g., "Refine scalability, enhance operational efficiency, explore AI/ML integrations."]

## 10. Stakeholders

Who are the key individuals or groups that need to understand, contribute to, or be aligned with this architecture vision?

* **Executive Leadership:** [For strategic alignment and resource allocation.]
* **Product Management:** [To ensure alignment with product roadmap and features.]
* **Development Leads/Teams:** [For guiding implementation and detailed design.]
* **Operations/DevOps Teams:** [For deployment, monitoring, and operational considerations.]
* **Security Team:** [For security reviews and compliance.]
