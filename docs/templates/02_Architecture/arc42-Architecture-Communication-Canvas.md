# 🗣️ arc42 Architecture Communication Canvas: [System/Project Name]

This canvas helps to plan and structure the communication of architectural information for the [System/Project Name]. Effective communication ensures that all stakeholders understand the architecture, its implications, and their role in its success.

---

## 1. Context & Scope

### 1.1 What is the architecture we are communicating?

[Briefly describe the system or part of the system whose architecture is being communicated. What are its boundaries?]

### 1.2 Why is this communication needed?

[What is the purpose of this communication? What problem are we solving or what goal are we achieving through this communication? (e.g., "to align development teams," "to get stakeholder approval," "to onboard new team members").]

## 2. Stakeholders

### 2.1 Who are the target audiences for this communication?

[Identify all relevant stakeholder groups. Think broadly: technical, business, operations, management, external partners, etc.]

* **[Stakeholder Group 1]:** [e.g., "Software Development Team"]
* **[Stakeholder Group 2]:** [e.g., "Product Management"]
* **[Stakeholder Group 3]:** [e.g., "Senior Leadership"]
* **[Stakeholder Group 4]:** [e.g., "Operations Team"]
* **[Stakeholder Group 5]:** [e.g., "External Auditors/Regulators"]

    * **Needs:** [e.g., "High-level system capabilities, impact on roadmap, cost implications."]
    * **Goal:** [e.g., "Inform product decisions, secure budget approval."]
* **[Stakeholder Group 3]:**
    * **Needs:** [e.g., "Strategic alignment, key risks, progress against objectives."]
    * **Goal:** [e.g., "Maintain oversight, make strategic decisions."]
* **[Stakeholder Group 4]:**
    * **Needs:** [e.g., "Deployment procedures, monitoring points, operational dependencies."]
    * **Goal:** [e.g., "Ensure smooth operations, facilitate troubleshooting."]
* **[Stakeholder Group 5]:**
    * **Needs:** [e.g., "Compliance evidence, traceability, security measures."]
    * **Goal:** [e.g., "Pass audits, demonstrate regulatory adherence."]

## 4. Communication Channels & Artifacts
