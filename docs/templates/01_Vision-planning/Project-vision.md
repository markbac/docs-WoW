# üöÄ Project Vision: [Project Name/Initiative]

This template outlines the fundamental purpose, scope, and desired outcomes for a specific project or initiative. It serves to align all stakeholders, provide clear direction, and ensure the project contributes effectively to broader organisational goals.

## üåü Project Name / Initiative Title

[Clearly state the name of the project or initiative.]

## ‚ú® Project Vision Statement

A concise and inspiring statement that articulates the desired future state or impact this project aims to achieve. It answers: "What success looks like at a high level once this project is complete?"

*Example: To establish a robust, scalable, and secure cloud infrastructure that enables rapid deployment of new services and reduces operational costs by Q4 2025.*

## üéØ Strategic Alignment & Purpose

How does this project align with and contribute to the overarching business strategy, product vision, or organisational objectives? Why is this project critical now?

* [Reference relevant strategic goals, company OKRs, or product vision.]
* [Explain the fundamental reason for initiating this project.]

## üí° Problem / Opportunity Statement

Clearly articulate the primary problem(s) this project aims to solve, or the significant opportunity it aims to seize. What challenges exist that this project addresses? What new possibilities does it unlock?

*Example: Our current on-premise infrastructure is nearing capacity, lacks the agility for rapid scaling, and incurs high maintenance overhead, hindering our ability to innovate and respond to market demands.*

## üöÄ Key Objectives & Desired Outcomes

What specific, measurable objectives will this project achieve? These should be outcomes (what changes as a result), not just outputs (what we deliver). How will we know if the project is successful?

* **Objective 1:** [e.g., Reduce infrastructure operational costs by 20% within 12 months post-migration.]
* **Objective 2:** [e.g., Achieve 99.99% uptime for core services in the new environment.]
* **Objective 3:** [e.g., Enable self-service provisioning of development environments within 1 hour.]
* **Objective 4:** [e.g., Successfully migrate 80% of legacy applications to the new platform by [Date].]

## üåê Scope & Boundaries

What is definitively *in scope* for this project? What is *out of scope*? This helps manage expectations, prevent scope creep, and focus efforts.

* **In Scope:**
    * [Specific deliverables, systems, or areas to be addressed.]
    * [e.g., Cloud platform setup and configuration (AWS/Azure/GCP).]
    * [e.g., Migration of applications A, B, and C.]
    * [e.g., Development of automated deployment pipelines for new services.]
* **Out of Scope:**
    * [Specific items, features, or phases that will NOT be part of this project.]
    * [e.g., Migration of all legacy applications (beyond A, B, C).]
    * [e.g., Custom application development (unless directly related to platform features).]
    * [e.g., Long-term operational support model (will be defined by a subsequent initiative).]

## üë• Key Stakeholders

Who are the primary individuals, teams, or groups who have a vested interest in this project's success or are significantly impacted by it?

* **Project Sponsor(s):** [Names/Roles]
* **Key Business Leads:** [Names/Roles]
* **Affected Teams/Departments:** [Names/Roles, e.g., Software Development, Operations, Product Management]
* **Key Users/Customers:** [Representing the end-users of the project's outcomes]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è High-Level Risks & Assumptions

What are the major known risks that could impact the project's success? What critical assumptions are we making that, if proven false, could derail the project?

* **Risks:**
    * [e.g., Unforeseen technical complexity in legacy application migration.]
    * [e.g., Lack of sufficient skilled resources for new cloud technologies.]
* **Assumptions:**
    * [e.g., Key vendor XYZ will provide timely support for integration.]
    * [e.g., Budget approval for cloud services will be granted as estimated.]
