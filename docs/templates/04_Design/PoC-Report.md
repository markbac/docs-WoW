# ðŸ”¬ Proof of Concept (PoC)/ Spike: [Topic/Question Being Explored]

This report details the findings of a Proof of Concept (PoC) / Spike conducted to explore [briefly state the topic or question]. The aim was to [state the objective] and provide recommendations for future development.

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of this PoC / Spike

The purpose of this PoC/Spike was to:
* [e.g., "Assess the feasibility of integrating with [New Technology X]."]
* [e.g., "Evaluate the performance characteristics of [Algorithm Y] under load."]
* [e.g., "Determine the best approach for [Complex Problem Z]."]
* [e.g., "De-risk a specific technical unknown related to [Component A]."]

### 1.2 Background / Context

Provide a brief overview of the problem, requirement, or technical unknown that necessitated this investigation. Why is this PoC/Spike important now?

### 1.3 Scope of this PoC / Spike

[Clearly define what was included in this investigation and, importantly, what was *not* included.]

* **In Scope:**
    * [Specific aspect 1 to be explored]
    * [Specific aspect 2 to be explored]
* **Out of Scope:**
    * [Aspect 1 not covered (e.g., "full production readiness," "comprehensive error handling")]

## 2. Hypothesis / Questions to Answer

[What specific questions were you trying to answer, or what hypothesis were you trying to prove/disprove?]

* **Question 1:** [e.g., "Can [New Technology X] achieve the required throughput of 1000 transactions/second?"]
* **Question 2:** [e.g., "What is the learning curve for our team to adopt [New Framework Y]?"]
* **Hypothesis:** [e.g., "Integrating with [Service Z] via its gRPC API will be more performant than its REST API."]

## 3. Methodology & Approach

[Describe how the PoC/Spike was conducted. What steps were taken? What tools, libraries, or environments were used?]

* **Steps Taken:**
    1. [Step 1]
    2. [Step 2]
    3. [Step 3]
* **Environment:** [e.g., "Local development machine," "Cloud sandbox environment."]
* **Tools/Technologies Used:** [e.g., "Python 3.9, FastAPI, PostgreSQL," "Arduino IDE, ESP32 dev board."]
* **Timebox:** [e.g., "Allocated 3 days for this spike."]

## 4. Findings & Results

[Present the observations, data, and results of your investigation. Be objective and factual. Include any relevant metrics, code snippets, diagrams, or screenshots.]

* **[Finding 1]:** [e.g., "Integration with [New Technology X] was successful, achieving 850 transactions/second."]
    * *Details:* [Provide supporting data, e.g., "See attached `performance_log.txt`."]
* **[Finding 2]:** [e.g., "The learning curve for [New Framework Y] was moderate, requiring approximately 2 days for basic proficiency."]
    * *Details:* [Mention specific challenges encountered.]
* **[Finding 3]:** [e.g., "gRPC integration with [Service Z] showed a 20% performance improvement over REST."]
    * *Details:* [Include benchmark results table/graph.]

## 5. Analysis & Discussion

[Interpret the findings. Did you answer your questions or prove/disprove your hypothesis? Discuss any implications, trade-offs, or unexpected discoveries.]

* [e.g., "While [New Technology X] didn't meet the exact throughput target, the results are promising given the initial setup."]
* [e.g., "The performance gain from gRPC is significant, but the increased complexity of tooling needs to be considered."]
* [e.g., "Discovered a critical limitation of [Library Z] that was not apparent in its documentation."]

## 6. Conclusions

[Summarize the key conclusions drawn from the PoC/Spike.]

* [e.g., "Integration with [New Technology X] is feasible, but requires further optimization for full performance."]
* [e.g., "Adopting [New Framework Y] is viable with dedicated training."]
* [e.g., "gRPC is the preferred communication protocol for [Service Z] due to performance benefits."]

## 7. Recommendations

[Based on your conclusions, provide clear, actionable recommendations for the next steps. These might include proceeding with development, further investigation, or choosing an alternative path.]

* **Recommendation 1:** [e.g., "Proceed with integrating [New Technology X] into the system, focusing on performance tuning in the next sprint."]
* **Recommendation 2:** [e.g., "Allocate 1 week of dedicated training for the team on [New Framework Y] before starting development."]
* **Recommendation 3:** [e.g., "Document the gRPC integration pattern via an ADR (ADR-XXX) and apply it to [Service Z]."]
* **Recommendation 4:** [e.g., "Re-evaluate alternative solutions for [Problem Z] due to discovered limitations of [Library Z]."]

## 8. Lessons Learned (from the PoC/Spike process itself)

[Reflect on the process of conducting this PoC/Spike. What went well, what could be improved for future investigations?]

* [e.g., "Timeboxing the spike was effective for focused investigation."]
* [e.g., "Should have involved [Stakeholder] earlier in defining the success criteria."]
