## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the high-level functional, non-functional, safety, and compliance requirements for the [Product/System Name]. It provides a common understanding for all stakeholders, including product management, engineering teams (software, firmware, hardware, mechanical), quality assurance, and regulatory affairs.

### 1.2 Scope

This document covers the system-level requirements for the [Product/System Name]. It does not delve into detailed design or implementation specifics, which will be covered in subsequent, more granular design and requirements documents (e.g., software requirements specifications, hardware design documents).
