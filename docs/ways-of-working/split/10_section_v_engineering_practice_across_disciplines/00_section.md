# SECTION V – ENGINEERING PRACTICE ACROSS DISCIPLINES

Cornerstone is intentionally multi-disciplinary. It exists for organisations building real products, not abstractions. Section V addresses how Cornerstone’s philosophy and framework translate into **day-to-day engineering practice across software, firmware, hardware, mechanical, and quality disciplines**, while preserving coherence at the system level.

A common failure mode in product development is treating disciplines as loosely coupled silos, each operating with its own methods, artefacts, and success measures. This leads to local optimisation, late integration, brittle interfaces, and systemic risk that only becomes visible when it is expensive or irreversible. Section V is explicitly designed to prevent that outcome.

This section treats engineering practice as a **socio-technical system**. Code, schematics, CAD models, tests, simulations, and tooling are inseparable from communication patterns, decision rights, and organisational structure. Technical excellence is not achieved through tools or techniques alone, but through the alignment of people, practices, and architecture around a shared purpose.

Section V makes explicit that different disciplines operate on **different timescales and cost curves**. Software is cheap to change, hardware is not. Firmware sits in between. Mechanical and manufacturing decisions carry long-lived consequences. Cornerstone does not attempt to flatten these differences. Instead, it provides a structured way to coordinate them through:
- Clear interfaces and ownership boundaries  
- Iterative learning where it is cheap and early  
- Deliberate commitment points where change becomes costly  

Quality engineering is treated as a **system-level property**, not a downstream function. Verification and validation are integrated into everyday practice across disciplines, with explicit traceability back to requirements, risks, and business intent. This allows Cornerstone to align naturally with regulated and safety-critical environments without distorting delivery.

Modern engineering realities are addressed directly. Section V includes guidance on:
- Continuous integration across heterogeneous toolchains  
- Simulation, emulation, and hardware-in-the-loop testing  
- Managing technical debt and architectural drift over long lifecycles  
- Integrating AI-assisted development and agent-based tooling responsibly  

The emphasis throughout is on **coherence over uniformity**. Cornerstone does not mandate identical practices across disciplines. It mandates shared intent, shared interfaces, and shared accountability for outcomes. Practices are allowed to vary where it makes sense, provided they strengthen the overall system rather than fragment it.

By the end of Section V, the reader should understand:
- How different engineering disciplines fit together as a single delivery system  
- How to manage integration, testing, and change across uneven iteration speeds  
- How to maintain architectural and quality integrity over time  
- How to apply Cornerstone in modern, tool-rich, AI-augmented environments  

Section V grounds Cornerstone in engineering reality. It is where the framework proves that it can support the messy, constrained, high-stakes work of building real products, not just elegant diagrams.
