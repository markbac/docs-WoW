# Acknowledgements
This book draws on ideas that have been developed, challenged, and refined over many years. While the framework presented here is my own, it stands on the shoulders of thinkers and practitioners who have consistently prioritised clarity, humanity, and systems over fashion.

In particular, I owe an intellectual debt to those who have articulated why organisations fail when they confuse activity with progress, efficiency with effectiveness, and control with leadership. The influence of work on systems thinking, organisational behaviour, software engineering discipline, and motivation is present throughout, even where not explicitly cited.

I am grateful to the colleagues, peers, and teams I have worked alongside, who tolerated strong opinions, challenged weak ones, and demonstrated daily that capable people struggle in poorly designed systems. Every delivery failure that “made no sense at the time” contributed something to this framework.

Thanks are also due to those who reviewed early drafts, argued back, or asked the awkward questions. Disagreement sharpened the work far more than agreement ever could.

Finally, this book would not exist without the patience and support of my family, who accepted evenings and weekends spent writing about systems while living inside one.

Any errors, omissions, or stubborn positions remain my own.
