## Appendix A – Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines how key terms are used **specifically within Cornerstone**.  
Many of these words are commonly used in engineering and management, but Cornerstone applies them with **deliberate, precise meaning**. Where Cornerstone’s usage differs from casual or industry-ambiguous definitions, that distinction is made explicit.

This appendix is normative.  
When a term appears elsewhere in the book, it carries the meaning defined here.



### Architecture
The structural design of technical systems, including software, hardware, platforms, infrastructure, interfaces, and integration boundaries.  
In Cornerstone, architecture is not an abstract technical artefact but a **delivery-enabling system** that encodes assumptions about change, ownership, coordination, and risk. Architecture directly shapes flow, autonomy, and long-term system health.



### Architectural Guardrails
Explicit constraints, principles, and boundaries that guide architectural decision-making without prescribing specific solutions.  
Guardrails enable decentralised decision-making while preserving coherence and reducing systemic risk. They are a mechanism for **lightweight governance**, not control.



### Blame
The attribution of failure to individuals rather than to system design, incentives, or constraints.  
Cornerstone treats blame as a **learning inhibitor** that suppresses information, delays risk discovery, and degrades system health.



### Cognitive Load
The total amount of mental effort required to perform work within a system.  
High cognitive load reduces decision quality, slows learning, and increases error rates. Cornerstone treats cognitive load as a **design constraint** influenced by architecture, team structure, tooling, and governance.



### Context
The shared understanding of purpose, constraints, priorities, risks, and boundaries within which teams operate.  
Context enables autonomy by allowing teams to make good decisions without constant escalation. Lack of context produces defensive behaviour and local optimisation.



### Delivery System
The end-to-end system by which ideas move from concept to customer.  
Includes batch sizes, handoffs, validation mechanisms, feedback loops, risk management, and release practices. Delivery performance is determined primarily by system design rather than individual effort.



### Decision Latency
The time taken for a decision to be made and acted upon once it is needed.  
Decision latency is a key signal of organisational health. Excessive latency indicates unclear authority, over-governance, or fear-based systems.



### Decision Record (ADR)
A lightweight, durable record of a significant decision, including its context, rationale, trade-offs, and consequences.  
ADRs exist to preserve **system memory**, not to create documentation overhead.



### Empowered Autonomy
The ability for teams to make decisions independently **within clearly defined boundaries**.  
Empowered autonomy is neither uncontrolled freedom nor delegated responsibility without authority. It is autonomy enabled by context and constrained by shared intent.



### Engineering Function
The organisational capability responsible for creating value through engineering activity.  
In Cornerstone, the engineering function exists to **deliver value to customers and, in doing so, create value for the business — sustainably and repeatedly**.



### Engineering Leadership
The non-delegable responsibility for designing, aligning, governing, and evolving the systems that produce engineering outcomes.  
Engineering leadership is a systems discipline, not a role, title, or set of ceremonies.



### Feedback Loop
A mechanism by which the outcomes of decisions or actions influence future decisions.  
Fast, honest feedback is essential for learning. Delayed feedback amplifies risk and cost.



### Flow
The rate at which value moves through the system from idea to customer.  
Flow is distinct from activity or speed. Good flow is predictable, low-variance, and enables rapid learning.



### Framework
The structured set of decision logic, governance mechanisms, and boundaries that translate philosophy into repeatable organisational behaviour.  
In Cornerstone, the framework sits **between philosophy and process** and constrains both.



### Governance
The mechanisms by which decisions are guided, constrained, reviewed, and escalated.  
Cornerstone defines governance as **decision support**, not decision suppression. Its purpose is to improve decision quality while enabling autonomy.



### Human Systems
Systems involving people, including motivation, trust, incentives, psychological safety, communication patterns, and decision-making dynamics.  
Cornerstone assumes people behave rationally within the systems they are placed in.



### Learning System
A system designed to detect signals, generate feedback, and adapt behaviour over time.  
Delivery is treated as a learning system, not merely an execution pipeline.



### Local Optimisation
Improving performance in one part of a system at the expense of overall system health.  
Cornerstone treats local optimisation as a primary source of systemic failure.



### Outcome
A meaningful, observable change in the world that creates value for customers or the business.  
Outcomes are distinct from outputs, which are intermediate artefacts such as features or documents.



### Output
An artefact produced by engineering activity, such as code, designs, or documentation.  
Outputs only matter insofar as they lead to outcomes.



### Philosophy
The explicit set of beliefs, values, and constraints that define what matters and why.  
In Cornerstone, philosophy constrains the framework, which in turn constrains process.



### Process
The specific practices, tools, workflows, and ceremonies used to execute work in a given context.  
Processes are intentionally flexible and context-dependent, provided they align with the framework and philosophy.



### Psychological Safety
A system property in which individuals can speak up, admit uncertainty, report failure, and challenge assumptions without disproportionate personal risk.  
Psychological safety is a prerequisite for learning, not a lack of accountability.



### Queue
Any point at which work waits rather than progresses.  
Queues increase lead time, hide risk, and delay feedback. They are a primary cost centre in delivery systems.



### Slack
Deliberately unallocated capacity within a system that enables learning, recovery, improvement, and adaptation.  
Slack is not waste. It is a **structural requirement** for resilience and long-term performance.



### Socio-Technical System
The interaction between people and technology, including tooling, automation, documentation, CI/CD, observability, and operational workflows.  
Technical systems always encode assumptions about communication, authority, and responsibility.



### Stewardship
Leadership responsibility exercised over time, focused on system health rather than short-term optimisation.  
Stewardship prioritises sustainability, learning, and long-term value over immediate efficiency.



### System
A set of interacting elements whose collective behaviour produces outcomes over time.  
In Cornerstone, systems include human, organisational, socio-technical, delivery, technical, and economic systems.



### System Health
The ability of a system to deliver value predictably, adapt to change, and recover from failure without degrading over time.  
System health is prioritised over short-term efficiency.



### Technical Debt
The accumulated cost of decisions that make future change more difficult, expensive, or risky.  
Cornerstone treats technical debt as a **strategic and economic concern**, not merely a technical one.



### Utilisation
The proportion of available capacity that is actively engaged in work.  
Cornerstone explicitly rejects utilisation maximisation as a primary management objective, as it degrades flow and resilience.



### Value
A meaningful benefit realised by a customer or the business.  
Value is contextual, outcome-based, and realised only when solutions perform effectively in real conditions.



### Work in Progress (WIP)
All work that has been started but not yet completed.  
High WIP increases queues, delays feedback, and reduces predictability. Cornerstone treats WIP as a controllable system variable.



### Whole-System Optimisation
The practice of improving overall system outcomes, even when it reduces apparent efficiency in individual components.  
Cornerstone consistently prioritises whole-system optimisation over local gains.



This glossary is intentionally comprehensive.  
Its purpose is not academic precision, but **shared understanding**, enabling consistent interpretation and application of the Cornerstone philosophy across teams, roles, and contexts.
