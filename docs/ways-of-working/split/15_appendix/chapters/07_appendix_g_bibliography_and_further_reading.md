## Appendix G – Bibliography and Further Reading

This bibliography is deliberate and opinionated.

The works listed here directly inform the philosophy, structure, and delivery logic of Firmitas. They shape how Firmitas treats leadership, systems, risk, learning, architecture, flow, quality, and human behaviour. These are not optional influences; they are the intellectual foundations that prevent Firmitas from collapsing into a shallow hybrid of existing methods.

Where appropriate, short context is provided to explain why each work matters.



### G.1 Systems Thinking and Organisational Dynamics

#### Donella H. Meadows – *Thinking in Systems*
Foundational to Firmitas’s systems worldview. Reinforces feedback loops, leverage points, and long-term consequences. Firmitas’s rejection of local optimisation and short-term efficiency is rooted directly in this work.

#### W. Edwards Deming – *Out of the Crisis*
Introduces the idea that most failures are systemic, not individual. Firmitas’s leadership stance, quality philosophy, and rejection of blame are deeply Deming-aligned.

#### Russell Ackoff – *Re-Creating the Corporation*
Explains why optimising parts of a system degrades the whole. Directly informs Firmitas’s portfolio thinking and organisational design guidance.



### G.2 Leadership, Authority, and Responsibility

#### L. David Marquet – *Turn the Ship Around!*
Strong influence on Firmitas’s leadership model. Authority is pushed to where information exists, while accountability remains with leadership. This aligns with Firmitas’s “context over control” stance.

#### Simon Sinek – *Start With Why*, *Leaders Eat Last*, *The Infinite Game*
Reinforces:
- Purpose-driven leadership
- Long-term, infinite-game thinking
- Leadership as stewardship of people and systems  
Firmitas adopts these ideas explicitly while grounding them in delivery reality.

#### Jocko Willink & Leif Babin – *Extreme Ownership*
Informs Firmitas’s principle that leadership responsibility for system health cannot be delegated, even when authority is distributed.

#### General Stanley McChrystal – *Team of Teams*
Supports Firmitas’s emphasis on adaptability, decentralised execution, and information flow in complex environments.

#### Frederic Laloux – *Reinventing Organizations*
Influences Firmitas’s thinking on organisational evolution, trust, and self-management, without assuming idealised maturity.



### G.3 Human Systems, Motivation, and Team Health

#### Tom DeMarco & Tim Lister – *Peopleware*
One of the strongest influences on Firmitas.
Key ideas adopted directly:
- Productivity is dominated by system design
- Interruptions destroy thinking
- Environment matters more than tools

#### Tom DeMarco – *Slack*
Provides the intellectual basis for Firmitas’s insistence that slack is structural, not waste. Zero-slack systems are fragile and unethical.

#### Dan Pink – *Drive*
Informs Firmitas’s treatment of autonomy, mastery, and purpose as system design goals rather than motivational techniques.

#### Susan Fowler – *Why Motivating People Doesn’t Work… and What Does*
Reinforces intrinsic motivation and autonomy-supportive leadership, aligning with Firmitas’s rejection of incentive-driven control.

#### Patrick Lencioni – *The Five Dysfunctions of a Team*
Used selectively to support Firmitas’s focus on trust, conflict, and accountability, without oversimplifying team dynamics.

#### Kim Scott – *Radical Candor*
Supports Firmitas’s stance on high-trust, high-accountability leadership communication.



### G.4 Engineering Management and Leadership Practice

#### Camille Fournier – *The Manager’s Path*
Informs Firmitas’s guidance on engineering leadership roles, progression, and responsibility boundaries.

#### Will Larson – *An Elegant Puzzle*
Strong alignment with Firmitas’s systems-first view of engineering management, especially around scaling and organisational constraints.

#### Michael Lopp – *Managing Humans*
Reinforces Firmitas’s people-centred leadership stance with practical, experience-based insight.

#### Ben Collins-Sussman, Brian Fitzpatrick, Dan Pilone – *Team Geek*
Supports Firmitas’s emphasis on humility, trust, and collaboration in technical teams.



### G.5 Software Engineering and Architecture

#### Frederick P. Brooks – *The Mythical Man-Month*
Firmitas’s scepticism of heroics, linear scaling, and schedule compression comes directly from Brooks.

#### John Ousterhout – *A Philosophy of Software Design*
Strong influence on Firmitas’s architectural principles:
- Complexity as the primary enemy
- Cognitive load as a first-class concern

#### Mark Richards & Neal Ford – *Fundamentals of Software Architecture*
#### Mark Richards & Neal Ford – *Software Architecture: The Hard Parts*
Inform Firmitas’s architectural decision-making, trade-off analysis, and evolutionary design stance.

#### Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, Patrick Kua – *Building Evolutionary Architectures*
Directly informs Firmitas’s approach to change, fitness functions, and long-lived systems.

#### Nick Rozanski & Eóin Woods – *Software Systems Architecture*
Supports structured architectural reasoning without prescribing heavyweight frameworks.



### G.6 Flow, Economics, and Risk

#### Donald G. Reinertsen – *Managing the Design Factory*
#### Donald G. Reinertsen – *Principles of Product Development Flow*
Firmitas’s economic view of flow, batch size, queues, and cost of delay is heavily influenced by Reinertsen.

#### Tom DeMarco & Tim Lister – *Waltzing with Bears*
Informs Firmitas’s explicit risk management stance and rejection of false certainty in planning.

#### Douglas W. Hubbard – *How to Measure Anything*
Supports Firmitas’s pragmatic approach to measurement, uncertainty, and decision-making under imperfect information.

#### Tom DeMarco – *The Deadline*
A narrative reinforcement of systems thinking, leadership behaviour, and organisational dysfunctions relevant to delivery.



### G.7 DevOps, Delivery, and Socio-Technical Systems

#### Forsgren, Humble, Kim – *Accelerate*
Empirical reinforcement of flow, feedback, and learning as predictors of performance.

#### Gene Kim et al. – *The DevOps Handbook*
Informs Firmitas’s socio-technical systems thinking and operational feedback loops.

#### Mary & Tom Poppendieck – *Lean Software Development*
Reinforces flow-based delivery and waste reduction without collapsing into minimalism.



### G.8 Team Design and Communication

#### Matthew Skelton & Manuel Pais – *Team Topologies*
Direct influence on Firmitas’s team design guidance, cognitive load management, and interaction modes.

#### Brandenburg & Strohschneider – *Communication Patterns*
Supports Firmitas’s explicit treatment of communication as a designed system, not an emergent property.



### G.9 Documentation, Knowledge, and Governance

#### Anne Gentle – *Docs as Code*
Direct influence on Firmitas’s documentation philosophy and artefact governance model.

#### The Agile Manifesto
Referenced as historical context and a source of values, not as a sufficient delivery model.



### G.10 How to Use This Bibliography

This bibliography is not meant to be read linearly.

Instead:
- Treat it as a map of ideas
- Revisit works as organisational maturity increases
- Use books as lenses, not rulebooks

Firmitas exists precisely because no single book, framework, or methodology is sufficient on its own.
