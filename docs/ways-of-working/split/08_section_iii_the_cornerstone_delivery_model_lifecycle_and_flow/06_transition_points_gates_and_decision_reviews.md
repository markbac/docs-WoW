## Transition Points, Gates, and Decision Reviews

Transition points and gates in Cornerstone exist for **alignment, confidence, and deliberate decision-making**.  
They do not exist to enforce bureaucracy, slow delivery, or reintroduce waterfall thinking by stealth.

This chapter explains how Cornerstone uses **explicit transition points**, **evidence-based gates**, and **decision reviews** to preserve systemic health while maintaining flow.

The defining difference is this:

> In Cornerstone, gates do not control teams.  
> Gates control **risk, uncertainty, and commitment**.



### Why Gates Exist (and Why Most Fail)

Gates fail in most organisations because they are used incorrectly.

Common failure modes include:
- gates that check document completion rather than understanding
- gates that exist to satisfy governance optics rather than risk reduction
- gates owned by people detached from delivery reality
- gates that appear late, when change is most expensive
- gates treated as approvals rather than decisions

Cornerstone rejects all of these patterns.

In Cornerstone, gates exist to answer a **small number of critical questions**, at the **right moment**, using **real evidence**, so leadership can decide whether to proceed, pause, redirect, or stop.



### Transition Points vs Gates vs Decision Reviews

Cornerstone deliberately distinguishes three related but different concepts.

#### Transition Points
A **transition point** is a natural shift in delivery posture.
It marks a change in emphasis, risk profile, or commitment level.

Examples include:
- moving from intent to active development
- moving from exploratory iteration to integrated system build
- moving from development focus to release and operational readiness

Transition points exist whether you name them or not.
Cornerstone makes them explicit so they can be managed deliberately.

#### Gates
A **gate** is a **decision checkpoint** aligned to a transition point.

A gate:
- does not exist continuously
- does not micromanage execution
- does not prescribe how teams work

Instead, it asks:
> “Do we have sufficient evidence and confidence to proceed responsibly?”

#### Decision Reviews
A **decision review** is the structured conversation that occurs at a gate.

Its purpose is:
- to surface assumptions
- to examine evidence
- to discuss risk
- to make a clear decision and record it

Decision reviews are collaborative, not adversarial.



### Gates as Risk and Commitment Controls

Cornerstone treats gates as **controls on commitment**, not on activity.

As a product progresses:
- financial commitment increases
- reputational risk increases
- regulatory exposure increases
- opportunity cost increases

Gates exist to ensure that:
- commitments are intentional
- uncertainty is acceptable
- learning has occurred
- risk is understood and owned

Skipping gates does not remove risk.
It simply hides it.



### Evidence, Not Artefacts

Cornerstone gates are evidence-driven.

Evidence may include:
- working prototypes
- test results
- simulation data
- operational metrics
- risk registers
- architectural decisions with rationale
- demonstrated behaviour, not promises

Documents may support evidence.
Documents alone are never sufficient.

This directly addresses a core failure of traditional gated models:
the substitution of paperwork for understanding.



### The Minimal Set of Cornerstone Transition Points

Cornerstone does not mandate a fixed number of gates for all contexts.
However, most implementations converge on three **structurally meaningful transition points**.

#### Transition Point 1 – Intent to Commitment
This transition answers:
- Do we understand the problem?
- Do we understand the system context?
- Are the major risks visible?
- Is the architectural direction plausible?

This is **not** a design freeze.
It is a commitment to learn through building.

#### Transition Point 2 – Build to Integrate
This transition answers:
- Are the major components working?
- Are interfaces stable enough to integrate?
- Have the highest risks been addressed?
- Is system-level behaviour emerging as expected?

This is where optimism is replaced by evidence.

#### Transition Point 3 – Integrate to Release
This transition answers:
- Does the system meet its critical requirements?
- Is operational readiness proven?
- Are regulatory and quality obligations met?
- Are known risks acceptable?

This is not perfection.
It is **fitness for purpose with known residual risk**.



### Gates in Continuous and Non-Project Work

Cornerstone explicitly supports continuous product development.

In continuous contexts:
- gates become periodic confidence checks
- transition points align to releases or capability milestones
- decision reviews focus on trajectory, not completion

This avoids the false dichotomy between “projects” and “continuous delivery”.
All work still carries risk.
All risk still deserves governance.



### Leadership Responsibilities at Gates

Leadership responsibility does not end at delegation.

At gates, leaders are responsible for:
- creating psychological safety so real issues surface
- asking hard questions without blame
- resisting pressure to “wave things through”
- making explicit trade-offs
- owning decisions and their consequences

Delegating gate decisions without accountability is abdication, not empowerment.



### Recording Decisions Without Bureaucracy

Cornerstone requires that **decisions are recorded**, not endlessly debated.

This is typically done via:
- concise decision records
- linked ADRs
- risk acceptance statements
- explicit “why we proceeded” notes

These records:
- preserve context
- support learning
- enable future review
- protect teams from hindsight bias

They are lightweight by design.



### Gates, Autonomy, and Trust

Properly implemented, gates **increase** autonomy.

They do this by:
- clarifying boundaries
- making expectations explicit
- reducing surprise interventions
- building trust through transparency

Teams are free to choose *how* to deliver.
Gates exist to decide *whether to proceed*.

This distinction is critical.



### When Gates Should Stop Work

Cornerstone explicitly allows for stopping.

A gate may result in:
- proceed as planned
- proceed with conditions
- pause and reduce risk
- pivot direction
- stop the initiative

Stopping is not failure.
Continuing blindly is.

Systems that cannot stop are unsafe systems.



### Gates and Slack

Effective gates require slack.

If:
- teams are overloaded
- schedules are brittle
- delivery is permanently “urgent”

Then:
- evidence is rushed
- risks are hidden
- gates become theatre

Slack is what allows:
- honest assessment
- proper validation
- thoughtful decision-making

This ties directly back to Cornerstone’s stance on sustainability and long-term performance.



### Summary

In Cornerstone:
- transition points make change explicit
- gates manage risk and commitment
- decision reviews create alignment and accountability

They exist to:
- protect people
- protect the system
- protect the organisation

Not to slow delivery, but to ensure that **speed does not outrun understanding**.

The next chapter explores how Cornerstone manages **change after commitment** without collapsing into either chaos or rigidity.
