# ðŸ“¦ Software Bill of Materials (SBOM): [Product/System Name] v[Version Number]

This document lists all software components, including open-source and commercial, that are incorporated into [Product/System Name] version [Version Number]. It provides transparency into our software supply chain, enabling proactive vulnerability management, license compliance, and risk assessment.

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is to:
* Provide a comprehensive inventory of all software components within the product.
* Facilitate vulnerability management by identifying affected components when new vulnerabilities are disclosed.
* Ensure compliance with open-source and third-party software licenses.
* Support security auditing and risk assessment activities.
* Enhance transparency and trust in our software supply chain.

### 1.2 Scope

This SBOM covers all software components (libraries, frameworks, operating systems, firmware, etc.) that are part of, or linked into, the [Product/System Name] version [Version Number]. It includes both direct dependencies and transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies).

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms

* **Component:** A distinct software package, library, or module.
* **Direct Dependency:** A component explicitly listed in the product's build or manifest file.
* **Transitive Dependency:** A component that is a dependency of a direct dependency (or further down the chain).
* **CPE (Common Platform Enumeration):** A standardized naming scheme for software applications, operating systems, and hardware devices.
* **PURL (Package URL):** A URL string that identifies and locates a software package.
* **SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange):** An open standard for communicating SBOM information.
* **CycloneDX:** A lightweight SBOM standard designed for use in application security contexts and supply chain component analysis.

## 2. SBOM Generation Details

### 2.1 Generation Tool(s)

* **Configuration/Command:** [e.g., `syft dir:./ --output spdx-json=sbom.json`]

### 2.2 Source of Analysis

[Describe where the SBOM was generated from (e.g., source code repository, built artifact, container image).]

* **Location:** [e.g., `git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git#v1.0.0`]
* **Artifact Hash (if applicable):** [e.g., SHA256 hash of the final build artifact]

### 2.3 SBOM Format

[Specify the format of the generated SBOM (e.g., SPDX JSON, CycloneDX JSON, SPDX Tag-Value).]

* **Format:** [e.g., SPDX JSON]
