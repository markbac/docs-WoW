# 🧪 Test Plan: [Product/System/Component Name] ([High-Level/Detailed])

This document outlines the test strategy, scope, objectives, and approach for verifying and validating the [Product/System/Component Name]. It serves as a guide for all testing activities, ensuring that the product meets its specified requirements and quality attributes.

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this test plan is to define the overall strategy and approach for testing the [Product/System/Component Name]. It specifies the scope of testing, objectives, test levels, roles and responsibilities, and the resources required.

### 1.2 Scope of Testing

[Clearly define what will be tested and what will not be tested. Be specific about features, modules, interfaces, and environments.]

* **In Scope:**
    * [Feature/Module 1]
    * [Interface X]
    * [Environment Y]
* **Out of Scope:**
    * [Feature/Module A (and why, e.g., "tested by another team," "deferred to next phase")]

### 1.3 Objectives

What are the specific goals of this testing effort?

* [e.g., "Verify all high-level functional requirements (SYS-FUN-XXX) are met."]
* [e.g., "Validate that the system meets specified performance criteria (SYS-NFR-PERF-YYY)."]
* [e.g., "Identify and report defects to ensure product quality."]
* [e.g., "Ensure compliance with safety standard Z."]

### 1.4 Test Levels

[Specify the test levels covered by this plan (e.g., Unit, Component, Integration, System, Acceptance).]

## 2. Test Strategy

### 2.1 Overall Test Approach

[Describe the general methodology for testing (e.g., "risk-based testing," "exploratory testing," "requirement-driven testing"). How will automation be leveraged?]

### 2.2 Test Environment

[Describe the hardware, software, network, and data configurations required for testing.]

* **Hardware:** [e.g., "Target Device Rev X, Test Rig Z"]
* **Software:** [e.g., "Firmware Version A, Application Version B, OS Version C"]
* **Network:** [e.g., "Simulated IoT network, Isolated lab environment"]
* **Data:** [e.g., "Test data sets, database configurations"]

### 2.3 Test Data Management

[How will test data be created, managed, and maintained?]

### 2.4 Test Tools

[List the tools to be used for test management, execution, automation, and defect tracking.]

* **Test Management:** [e.g., Jira with Xray, Azure DevOps Test Plans]
* **Automation:** [e.g., Pytest, Selenium, custom hardware test harnesses]
* **Defect Tracking:** [e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps]
* **Performance/Load Testing:** [e.g., JMeter, LoadRunner]

## 3. Test Deliverables

[What documents, reports, or artifacts will be produced as part of this testing effort?]

* **Test Cases:** [e.g., "Detailed test cases (manual/automated)"]
* **Test Execution Logs:**
* **Defect Reports:**
* **Test Summary Report:**
* **Traceability Matrix (updated):**

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

[Identify the key roles involved in testing and their responsibilities.]

* **Test Lead:** [Overall test strategy, planning, reporting]
* **Test Engineers:** [Test case design, execution, defect reporting]
* **Developers:** [Unit testing, defect fixing]
* **Product Owner:** [Acceptance criteria definition, UAT]

## 5. Test Cases (High-Level Plan) / Detailed Test Cases (Detailed Plan)

### 5.1 High-Level Test Scenarios (for High-Level Test Plan)

[Describe major test scenarios or functional areas to be covered.]

* **Scenario 1: [Name of Scenario]**
    * *Objective:* [What is this scenario trying to achieve?]
    * *Associated Requirements:* [e.g., SYS-FUN-001, SYS-NFR-PERF-005]
    * *Approach:* [Briefly describe the testing approach (e.g., "Automated end-to-end test," "Manual exploratory test").]
* **Scenario 2: [Name of Scenario]**
    * ...

### 5.2 Detailed Test Cases (for Detailed Test Plan)

[For detailed plans, list specific test cases. Use a structured format.]

* **Test Case ID:** [TC-XXX-001]
* **Test Case Name:** [Verify User Login with Valid Credentials]
* **Description:** [Ensure a registered user can successfully log in to the system.]
* **Pre-conditions:** [User account exists and is active.]
* **Steps:**
    1. [Navigate to login page.]
    2. [Enter valid username "testuser".]
    3. [Enter valid password "password123".]
    4. [Click "Login" button.]
* **Expected Result:** [User is redirected to the dashboard, and a "Welcome, testuser!" message is displayed.]
* **Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]
* **Type:** [Functional/Non-functional/Safety/Compliance]
* **Automation Status:** [Manual/Automated]
* **Trace to Requirement(s):** [e.g., COMP-FUN-005, SYS-FUN-010]

## 6. Defect Management Process

[How will defects be identified, reported, tracked, and retested?]

* **Defect Lifecycle:** [e.g., New -> Open -> Fixed -> Retest -> Closed]
* **Severity Levels:** [e.g., Critical, Major, Minor, Cosmetic]
* **Priority Levels:** [e.g., P1 (Blocker), P2 (High), P3 (Medium), P4 (Low)]

## 7. Reporting

[How will test progress and results be reported to stakeholders?]

* **Daily/Weekly Status Reports:**
* **Test Summary Reports:** [At key milestones or end of test cycles.]
* **Metrics:** [e.g., Test case execution rate, pass/fail rate, defect discovery rate, test coverage.]

## 8. Exit Criteria

[What conditions must be met for this testing phase to be considered complete?]

* [e.g., "All critical and major defects are resolved and retested successfully."]
* [e.g., "All high-priority test cases have passed."]
* [e.g., "Test coverage targets (e.g., 80% code coverage) are met (if applicable)."]
* [e.g., "Stakeholder sign-off on test results."]

## 9. Risks and Contingencies

[What are the potential risks to this test plan, and what are the contingency plans?]
