#### 3.1.2 Architectural Strategy / Solution

[Describe the high-level strategy for addressing security. e.g., "Implement a layered security approach with defense-in-depth principles. Utilize industry-standard encryption protocols. Adopt a 'least privilege' model for all access."]

* **Key Technologies/Patterns:** [e.g., TLS, OAuth 2.0, JWT, HSMs, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).]
* **Related ADRs:** [Link to relevant ADRs, e.g., ADR-005: "Choice of Authentication Protocol."]

#### 3.1.3 Implications

* **Benefits:** [e.g., "Reduced risk of data breaches," "Compliance with regulatory requirements," "Increased customer trust."]

#### 3.1.4 Implementation Guidelines

[Provide high-level guidelines for how this concern should be implemented across components.]

* **Data Protection:** All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).
* **Access Control:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all internal and external APIs.
* **Input Validation:** All external inputs must be validated at the service boundary.

* **Drawbacks/Trade-offs:** [e.g., "Storage costs for logs," "Performance overhead if logging is excessive."]

#### 3.2.4 Implementation Guidelines

* **Standardized Logging:** Use a common logging library and predefined log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL).
* **Contextual Logging:** Include relevant context (e.g., request ID, user ID, component name) in all logs.
* **Distributed Tracing:** Instrument services to support end-to-end tracing of requests.
* **Key Metrics:** Define and collect essential metrics for each service (e.g., request rates, error rates, latency).

### 3.3 Concern: Error Handling & Resilience (CC-003)

#### 3.3.1 Description

[Describe the approach to handling errors and ensuring the system can withstand and recover from failures.]

## 4. Application and Maintenance

### 4.1 Application Guidelines

* These concerns should be considered during all design phases (from high-level architecture to detailed component design).
* All new components and features must adhere to the defined strategies for these concerns.
* Any deviations must be explicitly justified and documented, ideally via an ADR.

### 4.2 Maintenance and Evolution

* This document is a living artifact and should be reviewed periodically (e.g., annually or as part of major architectural shifts).
* New crosscutting concerns may emerge and should be added as needed.
* Strategies may evolve based on new technologies, threats, or business needs.
