# 📝 RFC/Design Proposal: [Short, Descriptive Title of Proposal]

This document serves as a Request for Comments (RFC) or a Design Proposal for [briefly describe the area or problem this proposal addresses]. Its purpose is to present a proposed solution, explore its implications, and gather feedback from relevant stakeholders to inform a final decision.

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of this Document

The purpose of this RFC/Proposal is to [e.g., "propose a new approach for X," "detail a significant change to Y," "seek consensus on Z"]. It aims to provide sufficient context and detail to enable informed discussion and decision-making.

### 1.2 Background / Context

Provide a brief overview of the current situation, the system context, or the existing design that this proposal aims to change or augment. Why is this proposal necessary now? What led to this idea?

### 1.3 Problem Statement (if applicable)

If this proposal is addressing a specific problem, clearly articulate it here. What pain points, limitations, or inefficiencies does the current state have?

## 2. Proposed Solution / Design

Clearly describe the proposed solution or design. Be as specific as possible, including:

* **High-level overview:** What is the core idea?
* **Detailed description:** Explain how it works, including key components, interactions, and data flows.
* **Diagrams:** Use Mermaid, PlantUML, or other diagramming tools to illustrate the design (e.g., sequence diagrams, component diagrams).
* **Technical details:** Any specific technologies, algorithms, or patterns involved.
