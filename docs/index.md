# Welcome

This is a starter MkDocs site using the **Bootswatch â€“ Cerulean** theme with **local** diagram generation.

- Mermaid is pre-rendered to SVG during `mkdocs build`.
- PlantUML uses a local `plantuml.jar` plus Graphviz `dot` to render to SVG.
- PDF artefacts are generated per page using the `mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin` and saved under `site/pdf/`.
