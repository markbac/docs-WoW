# Software Development Process Flow – End-to-End

This document describes an end-to-end process flow for a software development team.  
It covers **requirements definition**, **feature creation**, **sprint development**, **code quality gates**, **test & verification**, and **system integration testing** — with **feedback loops at every stage**.

---

## 🧭 Process Overview

The overall process follows these steps:
1. **Requirements** are created by the Product Manager and reviewed.
2. **Features** are defined by the Architect, reviewed by the team, and accepted.
3. The software team refines features into **user stories**.
4. Delivery happens in **3-week sprints** using feature branches.
5. Before merging a feature branch:
   - All stories must be complete.
   - The build must compile and pass unit tests and static analysis.
   - Code review must be approved.
6. Once merged, a **build is created for T&V**.
7. **Test & Verification (T&V)** and **System Integration Testing (SIT)** provide structured feedback loops.
8. Rework can happen **at any stage** based on review findings, bugs, or changes in upstream requirements.

## 📝 Commentary & Rationale

- **Feedback loops** are intentionally present in *every phase*, not just testing.  
- **Requirements & features** have review cycles to ensure downstream teams work with clarity and stable inputs.  
- **Feature gates** before merge protect `main` and keep builds stable.
- **T&V** and **SIT** are treated as structured gates, not chaotic bug hunts.
- **Rework is planned**, not a surprise — stories or tasks can be created from findings and re-run through the process.
- This model aligns well with ADO/Jira workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and regulated development environments.

## 📌 Suggested Practice

| Stage | Trigger | Feedback Loop |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Requirement | Ambiguity, scope, missing acceptance | Back to PM for revision |
| Feature | Technical feasibility or unclear scope | Back to Architect |
| Dev | Build, static analysis, unit test failure | Developer fixes before merge |
| Code Review | Review comments | Developer updates |
| T&V | Defects found | Rework through sprint |
| SIT | Integration issues | Rework through sprint |
